== Configuring Logging for the JMS Client

The JMS Client logs messages using SLF4J (Simple Logging Fa√ßade for Java).
SLF4J delegates to a logging framework, such as https://logback.qos.ch/[Logback].
If no other logging framework is
enabled, SLF4J defaults to a built-in, no-op, logger.
See the http://www.slf4j.org/docs.html[SLF4J] documentation for a
list of the logging frameworks SLF4J supports.

We highly recommend to use a dependency management tool like http://maven.apache.org/[Maven]
or https://gradle.org/[Gradle] to manage dependencies.
